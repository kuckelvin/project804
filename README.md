Class Project - Predicting Academic Success and Retention Rates of Higher Education Students


This research study aims to predict academic success and dropout rates among college students.
The study aims to examine the predictors made available on a publicly accessible Kaggle
dataset, which offers detailed data on students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees.
The dataset contains information relating to academic data, macroeconomic factors, socialeconomic
factors, and demographics that are used in this study to investigate potential predictors
of student dropout and academic success. Additionally, the data provide illuminating
details about the factors that affect student success, which higher education institutions may
use to guide interventions and rules on student retention. The resultant information could help
higher education institutions objectively understand how their students progress academically
and identify areas requiring personal and institutional improvement. When used, the predictive
models created in this project will consider the student dropout risk factors discovered from
the dataset, encouraging early intervention to boost retention rates. As a result, they can develop
academic initiatives, programs, or activities specifically targeted at enhancing academic
achievement.
